# The Project

MapSwitch üó∫Ô∏è is an extension that allows you to open a different map in a new tab on the same location (latitude/longitude) as your currently viewed map.

NOTE That even though this browser extension is primarily targeted for Chromium it is possible to install it in various other browsers like **Firefox** and get it working.

## How to install?

* Clone this GIT repository to your machine, thus having a local "map-switch" folder.

### Chromium (Chrome/Brave/Edge).

* Navigate to extensions (either type `about:extensions` or click on the `three dots/dashes` top right, then `More Tools` and `Extensions`)
* Make sure to have `Developer Mode` enabled (top right)
* Click on the `Load unpacked` button
* Select the `map-switch` folder

### Firefox

* Type `about:debugging`
* Click on `This Firefox`
* Click on the `Load Temporary Add-on...` button
* Select the `manifest.json` file in `map-switch`
