# The Project

MapSwitch üó∫Ô∏è is an extension that allows you to open a different map in a new tab on the same location (latitude/longitude) as your currently viewed map.

NOTE Also works in Fire Fox (see below).

## How does it work?

* you are browsing a map site like `Google` or `OpenStreetMap`
* right-click somewhere to open your browser's context menu (i.e. not on the map directly, but on some othe relement)
* click `Show on` the service you want to open
* anew tab will be opened, and the map will be located at the same latitude/longitude with the same level of zoom.

## Release in Chrome Web Store
**I'd love to...** but it seems there's a bug when using Manifest v3 and they won't accept v2. I

With v3, the listeners on those menu item clicks are removed after 30 seconds when the `service worker` is shut down. When you then click on a menu item it simply wakes up the `service worker`, but the event is lost, you have to click a second time. So it basically stops working after 30 seconds of inactivity...

I don't want to introduce any crazy workaround which I then have to maintain.

## How to install?
